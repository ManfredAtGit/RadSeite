          <h2>Paris Brest Paris</h2>
          <p> 
          A tremendous experience! Not just from a sporting perspective. To join more than 5000 cyclists from around the world and participate in this 1200km cacyling marathon has been mind blowing. It took me 82 hours, including two naps of 3 and 2 hours to ride to Brest and back to Paris. In the end it was ruther difficult because I could not keep my head up and straight - a typical long distance phenomenon (Shermer neck syndrome). It has also been a great emotional experience with all the supporters along the 1200km along the roadside offering you free food and "bon courage" cheers - during day and in the middle of the night. It has been a great honour to be part of this event.</p>

          <h2>RaR 2016</h2>
          <p>I had to abandon the race after 8 rounds. No excuses - conditions for the race were almost perfect. But I couldn't find my rythm on this extreme up-and-down course. After the first 3 rounds with an average speed of 25km/h I slowed down more and more. I got overtaken by lots of drivers, some of them passing me by millimeters at 100km/h in the downhill decents. Morale was dropping rapidly and around midnight I decided to quit. I would have needed a longer rest of 1 or 2 hours to recover. However, I was just not in the mood to carry on and I wouldn't have been able to improve on my 2014-result of 16 rounds anyway. </p>

          <h2>Garmisch and Lindau/Lake constance 2016</h2>
          <p>Garmisch Partenkirchen is located in the far south of Germany, at the foot of Wetterstein ranges with the Zugspitze. The region offers stunning views of the surrounding mountains, but no opportunities to climb the mountains by bike or roadbike cycling in general. The drive to Mittenwald with a side trip on a private road to Elmau and the route through Oberau and Linderhof to Plansee are the only exception. Apart from that, one has to join the traffic on the few main roads, overtaking the frequent traffic jams on the left side - eyes wide open and hoping for the best.</p>
          <p>Lindau is a great place for the cycling tourist. Activities include the 200km+ long around-the-lake marathon (some parts might be ruther busy at holidays), some excursions in the Bregenz Forest (Dornbirn Bödele and Feldkirch with Furka Joch), Allgäu (avoid major roads like B12 and B31) and the traditional mountain time trial at the Pfänder.</p>

          <h2>Canada Tour 2011</h2>
          <p>In summer 2011 I ventured on my longest bike tour of 5 weeks across (parts of) Canada. The tour started in Vancouver in British Columbia. Following Crowsnest highway over the Rocky Mountains it led into Alberta and further to Medicien Hat. Here I joined the Trans Canada Highway 1 (Yes, cyclists can ride on the highway, no problem) to cross the prairies of Saskatchewan into Manitoba. I left highway 1 to ride the Red Coat Trail to Winnipeg.</p>
          <p>After long days in the prairies I longed for some variety. So I didn't carry on going further east, but flew back to Vancouver from where I took the ferry to the nearby Vancouver Island. Vancouver Island is a huge island and absolutely great for cycling. I rode to Victoria, from there a bit northwards along the west coast, crossing the island to Nanaimo and then along the east coast to Courtnay. I took the ferry to the mainland again and road south along shunsine coast to Vancouver. U N B E L I E V A B L E ! </p>
